## What makes you beautiful - One Direction
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful

You have stolen my heart, oh, yeah
Never let it go, oh, oh, no
Never let it go, oh, oh, oh
Lighting straight to my heart, oh, yeah
I got all the feels for sure
Yeah, I got all the feels for you, oh 

## My Money Don't Jiggle Jiggle It Folds - Duke & Jones
